## How to use Kyro's Lobby or other mods 

* Open your FAF Data directory in C:\ProgramData\FAForever or whatever.
* Find your nx2 file in /gamedata you want to mod
* Copy it and rename it to ```*.nx2.original```
* Modify the ```*.nx2``` game file.

## How it works:

* If there is an update, the md5 of the .original file is checked
* If its different, there is an update, the nx2 gets overidden and you get a notification that you need to remod the nx2 file. For that you will need to redo the instructions above.
