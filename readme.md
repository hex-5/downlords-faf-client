## What's different to the official release?
* This version contains the code that allows the modification of the nx2 gamefiles.
* To use this, download the jar-file from the releases and replace it in your Downlords installation folder.

## How to use Kyro's Lobby or other mods 

* Open your FAF Data directory in ```/ProgramData/FAForever``` or whatever.
* Find your ```*.nx2``` file in ```/ProgramData/FAForever/gamedata``` which you want to mod
* Copy it and rename it to ```*.nx2.original```
* Modify the ```*.nx2``` game file.

## How it works:

* If there is an update, the md5 of the ```.nx2.original``` file is checked
* If its different, there is an update, the ```.nx2``` gets overidden and you get a notification that you need to remod the new ```.nx2``` file. For that you will need to redo the instructions above.
